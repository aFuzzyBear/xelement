The Documentation for `astro-xelement` is set out in the following manner:

Creating components in Astro can be either daunting or exceedingly easy, and that depends on many factors. Our guides would help you expand your ability to write good Astro.

XElement aside, the methods we used can be used outwith XElement when it comes to writing Astro components and our examples would be in JavaScript, utilizing only standard and conventional methods that you will be able to find practiced elsewhere.

## [`blog`](https://github.com/aFuzzyBear/xelement/tree/master/docs/blog)

Where the informal and the verbose is given space. Technical documentation is in respects aimed at providing a tasteless experience when you are consuming them. We feel that there is also space for more informal, less beige style of writing that could help explain XElement to others in a different light.

This also gives us a slightly different platform to be able to discuss further developments and all things XElement, outwith the scope of the technical literature found elsewhere in these docs.

## Epilogue

These documents are a living form. They will change and content will grow over time. As much as this endeavour would be pushed by the authors and interested parties of the project.

It would be always be pleasure of ours to help receive content and be able to assist other users of XElement into contributing to the project.

XElement is more of a gift to other Astronauts, and as with gifts, there is no expected return, we just hope that you enjoy using XElement within your Astro projects, and we would be delighted to here of your stories and see your creations in the wild, so please do share them with us, via our Github.
