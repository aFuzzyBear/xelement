# Getting Started

There is no better way to learn how to swim than jumping in both feet into the deep-end.

With XElement you will find that the deep-end is quiet shallow, and the waters are warm.

To introduce you to XElement, how to write your components and how to utilize the methods that we provide. We will be making two very simple components.

The first being our maiden `<hello-world>` component and the second being the defacto `<counter>` component.

## `<HelloWorld>`

Without further ado let's create your first `XElement` component!

We will create a [*explicitly named XElement*](polymorphism#explicitly-declared-custom-elements) using the following syntax:

```jsx
const { HTMLElement : MyComponentName } = XElement
```

or you can use the [implicit](polymorphism#) variety in your projects following a similar manner as above, but we let XElement assign the correct `HTMLElement`

```jsx
const { HTMLElement || ComponentName } = XElement
```

Please note if you are using this method to use Pascal-Case for your naming, including those that are `HTMLElements`



```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-xelement'
const { h1 : HelloWorld } = XElement
---
<HelloWorld>
    !! Hello World !!
</HelloWorld>
```

This renders as `<h1> !! Hello World !! </h1>`

From here we can make this element do any number of things...

Using **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** we can make this dynamic when certain certain events are triggered or conditions are met.

An XElement can perform actions if it has been *clicked* on or if it is *visible* or if it has been *resized.* It can even `fetch` data and dynamically `import` files inside the element itself!

What you can do with this little `<HelloWorld>` component is entirely up to your imagination.

Let's make our `<HelloWorld>` component fade in, using the **Web Animation API**.

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-xelement'

const {h1:HelloWorld} = XElement

//Declaring the Keyframe sequence inside Astro
const fadeIn = [
    { 
        opacity: 0
    },
    {
        opacity: 1
    }
];
// Also declaring the timing options
const animationTiming = {
    duration: 1500,
    easing: 'ease-in',
    fill: 'both'
};

---
<HelloWorld
    @animate ={fadeIn}
    @timings ={animationTiming}
>
    !! Hello World !!
<HelloWorld>
```

Now, you should see the text 'Hello-World' fade nicely in to view.

## `<Counter>`

How could we not provide an example of a 'Counter'?

You will notice that Astro starter "framework" examples (e.g. React, Svelte etc.) contain a counter component to show you how framework components work in Astro.

With XElement, you can have a fully-functioning, interactive *Astro* counter component, no other framework required!


### Let Start

Let's create our own interactive `<Counter>` component. Note that this time, we will need to declare a few different XElements, one to represent each HTML element we wish to create.

Our counter requires two buttons, as well as a counter display. We also need to create a parent `<Counter>` container element. 

We can define all of these elements from XElement at once:

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-xelement'
const {..., button:Button, span:Display, Counter} = XElement
---
```

Here we are defining three different types HTML elements to create four distinct HTML elements. (Remember, we're making two buttons. So they are distinct elements in the document, but they are the same type of element!) 

Two types of these *Named Elements* are familiar HTML Elements: `<button>` and `<span>`. The parent component is our `<Counter>` and is not named. It produces an HTML `<counter>` element which is a `DocumentFragment`, a special type of HTML element. (reference link)

Let's see how we can make our XElement `<Counter>` component **do** some stuff: Add, subtract, display the current count. This is what the code looks like:

```astro
---
import XElement from 'astro-xelement'
const {..., button:Button, span:Display, Counter} = XElement
---
<Counter
    @do={(element,store)=>{
        store.count = 0 
    }}
    >
    
    <Button 
        @click={(event,store)=>{ 
        display.textContent =  ++store.count
    }}>
        +
    </Button>
    
     <Display id="display">0</Display>
    
    <Button 
        @click={(event,store)=>{
        display.textContent = --store.count
    }}>
        -
    </Button>
</Counter>
```
### `@` decorators
To start enhancing our component, we use one of the many `@` decorators recognized by `XElement` to specify what type of action we wish it to perform.

`@do` is a common instruction to "do" something. And in our buttons, we will use `@click` to describe an `onClick` action.

### `store`

XElement also provides a `store`: a special non-persistent data object that is available to all `XElement` components. This lets you *store* your data and allows it to be used elsewhere on the page. We are keeping track of our counter's `count` in this store object.

### `id`

Giving an `id` to an XElment, as we have done with `<Display>`, allows us to target that element from elsewhere in the component tree. In this example, we can update the counter's displayed count by referencing, then changing the `<Display>` element's `textContent`.

### Summary 
In this example, what we are asking our  parent element, the `<Counter>` to **do**  is initialise the `store` with a `count` of `0`. 

And, we are telling the buttons that when they receive a `click` event, they should increment or decrement the `store.count` and update the `display.textContent`.

This `<Counter>` example renders the following HTML to the page:
```html
<counter>
    <button>+</button> 
    <span id="display">0</span>
    <button>-</button> 
</counter>

```
